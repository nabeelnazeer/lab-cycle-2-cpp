## question 3

Write a C++ program using classes to perform bank transaction for n customers
(cust_name, acc_no, acc_type, balance). The program should be menu driven
and it should have the following menus like adding new account, withdraw
(keep a min balance of 500), deposit, balance enquiry and account statement
(cust_name, acc_no, acc_type, balance).

destructors as well as the dynamic memory allocation of a 2-D matrix.

destructors as well as the dynamic memory allocation of a 2-D matrix.

## question 6

Create a class TIME with members hours, minutes, seconds. Take input, add
two time objects by passing objects to function and display result.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%201/six.cpp)

## question 7

Write a C++ program to implement a class MATRIX with member functions such
as matrix_add, matrix_mult, matrix_transpose and matrix_trace.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%201/seven.cpp)

## question 8

Write a program to perform addition of two complex numbers using constructor
overloading. The first constructor which takes no argument is used to create
objects which are not initialized, second which takes one argument is used to
initialize real and imaginary parts to equal values and third which takes two
arguments is used to initialize real and imaginary parts to two different values.

## question 9

Write a C++ program to design a class having static member function named
showcount() which has the property of displaying the number of objects created
of the class.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%201/nine.cpp)

## question 10

Write a C++ program using class to process shopping list for a Departmental
Store. The list include details such as the code, name, price and quantity of
each item and perform the operations like adding & deleting items to the list
and printing the total value of a purchase order.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%201/ten.cpp)

## question 11

Write a Program to swap private data members of classes named as class_1,
class_2 using friend function.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%201/ten.cpp)

## question 12

Write a Program to design a class complex to represent complex numbers. The
complex class should use an external function (use it as a friend function) to
add two complex numbers. The function should return an object of type
complex representing the sum of two complex numbers.

# lab cycle 2

## Project 1: operator overloading

Write a C++ program to overload ==, !=, <, <=, > and >= operators as
member operator functions for a vector object.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/one.cpp)

## Project 2: operartor overloading to add and multiply complex numbers

Write a C++ program to design a class representing complex numbers and
having the functionality of performing addition & multiplication of two complex
numbers using operator overloading (Use friend operator functions).

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/two.cpp)

## Project 3: dot product and display vectors

Write a C++ program to overload operators like *, <<, >> using friend
function. The following overloaded operators should work for a class vector.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/three.cpp)

## Project 4: matrix multiplication and addition by overloading operators

Write a C++ program for developing a matrix class which can handle integer
matrices of different dimensions. Also overload the operator for addition and
multiplication of matrices. Use double pointers in your program to dynamically
allocate memory for the matrices.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/four.cpp)

## Project 5: multiple and multilevel inheritence

Write a C++ program to demonstrate the concept of Multiple and Multilevel
inheritance including constructors with parameters.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/five.cpp)

## Project 6: virtual base class on hybrid inheritence

Write a C++ program to design a student class representing student roll no. and
a test class (derived class of student) representing the scores of the student in
various subjects and sports class representing the score in sports. The sports and
test class should be inherited by a result class having the functionality to add
the scores and display the final result for a student. Demonstrate the concept of
Virtual base class on Hybrid inheritance.

:pushpin:[link to code](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/six.cpp)

## Project 7: implementation of constructors in inheritence

Write a C++ program illustrating how the constructors are implemented and the
order in which they are called when the classes are inherited. Use three classes
named alpha, beta and gamma such that alpha and beta are base classes and
gamma is a derived class inheriting alpha & beta.

## Project 8: runtime polymorphism

Write a C++ program to define classes Shapes, Circle, Square, Ellipse and
Rectangle with member functions to get the values for finding corresponding
areas and print the same. Utilize the concept of Abstract Class and Runtime
polymorphism to solve the problem.

abstract base classes.
