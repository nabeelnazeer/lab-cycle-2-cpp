# C++ Lab Projects

Welcome to my C++ Lab repository! This repository contains all of my C++ projects that I've worked on during my studies. Below you'll find a brief overview of each project and a link to the code.

## Project 1: operator overloading

Write a C++ program to overload ==, !=, <, <=, > and >= operators as
member operator functions for a vector object.

[question 1](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/one.cpp)

## Project 2: operartor overloading to add and multiply complex numbers

Write a C++ program to design a class representing complex numbers and
having the functionality of performing addition & multiplication of two complex
numbers using operator overloading (Use friend operator functions).

[question 2](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/two.cpp)

## Project 3: dot product and display vectors

Write a C++ program to overload operators like *, <<, >> using friend
function. The following overloaded operators should work for a class vector.

[question 4](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/three.cpp)

## Project 4: matrix multiplication and addition by overloading operators

Write a C++ program for developing a matrix class which can handle integer
matrices of different dimensions. Also overload the operator for addition and
multiplication of matrices. Use double pointers in your program to dynamically
allocate memory for the matrices.

[question 4](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/four.cpp)

## Project 5: multiple and multilevel inheritence

Write a C++ program to demonstrate the concept of Multiple and Multilevel
inheritance including constructors with parameters.

[question 5](https://github.com/nabeelnazeer/lab-cycle-2-cpp/blob/master/lab%202/five.cpp)

## Project 6: virtual base class on hybrid inheritence

Write a C++ program to design a student class representing student roll no. and
a test class (derived class of student) representing the scores of the student in
various subjects and sports class representing the score in sports. The sports and
test class should be inherited by a result class having the functionality to add
the scores and display the final result for a student. Demonstrate the concept of
Virtual base class on Hybrid inheritance.

[question 6]()

## Project 7: implementation of constructors in inheritence

Write a C++ program illustrating how the constructors are implemented and the
order in which they are called when the classes are inherited. Use three classes
named alpha, beta and gamma such that alpha and beta are base classes and
gamma is a derived class inheriting alpha & beta.

## Project 8: runtime polymorphism

Write a C++ program to define classes Shapes, Circle, Square, Ellipse and
Rectangle with member functions to get the values for finding corresponding
areas and print the same. Utilize the concept of Abstract Class and Runtime
polymorphism to solve the problem.
